## Introduction

Cloud Computing already is the future. Although it already has tech jobs totally related to Cloud (as Devops and SRE, for example), it is very important that developers know how to handle with all the new infrastructure to adapt yourselves to the inovations.

AWS (aka Amazon Web Services) is a Cloud Provider. Among the Cloud Computing context, big companies like Amazon, Microsoft and Google share the most part of the public usage (developers and other IT-related professions).

</p>

Holding the most part of the market share, the AWS platform exposes more than 100 services, with a lot of them serving to the same purpose, but generally with divergences in some operational mechanism (Serverless VS Virtual Machines VS Containers, for example) and in the pricing.

You don`t need to deeply know how to deal with each of these services, so this guide focus in the most important and essential services, as well as a vision more directioned to a Software Developer role.

Even though this repository explains the cloud environment based on the AWS, at the end everything is just a aggregation of services of a specific company, so all the cloud concepts are reusable to other Cloud Providers (just with other names, but still the exactly same idea).
